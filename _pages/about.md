I am a Ph.D. student in the [Data Mining Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](hanj.cs.illinois.edu). I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Electronic Engineering in Tsinghua University. My research interests focus on mining text data using minimal human supervision.
